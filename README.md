 - This project is for smart watch pdr 3.
 - I proposed the system that provide a pedestrian deak-reckoning serivce to user.
 - The system is needed game rotation vector (GRV) and map data.
 - The system do not need a magnetometer.
 - The map data is needed for calibrating the user's current position on the system.
 - Also, the map data is needed for calibrating the system since there is no magenetometer.
